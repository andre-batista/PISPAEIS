Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

ABSTRACT = {The imaging of dielectric targets hidden behind a wall is addressed in this paper. An analytical solver for a fast and accurate computation of the forward scattered field by the targets is proposed, which takes into account all the interactions of the electromagnetic field with the interfaces of the wall. Furthermore, an inversion procedure able to address the full underlying non-linear inverse scattering problem is introduced. This technique exploits a regularizing scheme in Lebesgue spaces in order to reconstruct an image of the hidden targets. Preliminary numerical results are provided in order to initially assess the capabilities of the developed solvers.},

Both the approaches are discussed. However, since many qualitative methods lead to resolution of linear ill-posed problems, some preliminary theory and tools useful in dealing with this class of problems are presented. In particular, the concepts of generalized inverse operators and generalized solutions are addressed, along with one of the most commonly used and powerful tools in linear inverse scattering, the singular value decomposition (SVD). Some basic concepts regarding regularization theory are also briefly introduced, without cumbersome mathematical details. It should be noted that the linear sampling method is only one of the qualitative techniques able to provide the shapes of unknown scatterers.

It is an iterative method that, at each iteration, updates the current trial solution by exploiting probabilistic concepts. Population-based algorithms can be used for imaging purposes with different implementation schemes. It should also be noted that population-based algorithms seem to be particularly suitable for the inclusion of a priori information into the model. From an engineering standpoint, a priori information is very important, since it can be used for accelerating the reconstruction procedure. In this chapter, simulated annealing is discussed first. Then, some population-based methods, which have already been proposed for microwave imaging applications are considered. Specifically, there are the genetic algorithm, the differential evolution method, the particle swarm optimization method, and the ant colony optimization method.

We study the orthogonality sampling method, which is a simple, fast, and robust imaging method for solving the inverse scattering problem. We provide a theoretical analysis as well as a stability estimate for the sampling method. An equivalent relation between the orthogonality sampling method and the direct sampling method is also established. The analysis uses the Factorization method for the far field operator, and it plays an important role in the justifications along with the Funk--Hecke integral identity. Finally, we present some numerical examples to validate the performance of the sampling methods for anisotropic scatterers in three dimensions. }

abstract = {Abstract A new method, based on an iterative procedure, for solving the two-dimensional inverse scattering problem is presented. This method employs an equivalent Neumann series solution in each iteration step. The purpose of the algorithm is to provide a general method to solve the two-dimensional imaging problem when the Born and the Rytov approximations break down. Numerical simulations were calculated for several cases where the conditions for the first order Born approximation were not satisfied. The results show that in both high and low frequency cases, good reconstructed profiles and smoothed versions of the original profiles can be obtained for smoothly varying permittivity profiles (lossless) and discontinuous profiles (lossless), respectively. A limited number of measurements around the object at a single frequency with four to eight plane incident waves from different directions are used. The method proposed in this article could easily be applied to the three-dimensional inverse scattering problem, if computational resources are available.},

ABSTRACT = {Evaluating the quality of reconstructed images requires consistent approaches to extracting information and applying metrics. Partitioning medical images into tissue types permits the quantitative assessment of regions that contain a specific tissue. The assessment facilitates the evaluation of an imaging algorithm in terms of its ability to reconstruct the properties of various tissue types and identify anomalies. Microwave tomography is an imaging modality that is model-based and reconstructs an approximation of the actual internal spatial distribution of the dielectric properties of a breast over a reconstruction model consisting of discrete elements. The breast tissue types are characterized by their dielectric properties, so the complex permittivity profile that is reconstructed may be used to distinguish different tissue types. This manuscript presents a robust and flexible medical image segmentation technique to partition microwave breast images into tissue types in order to facilitate the evaluation of image quality. The approach combines an unsupervised machine learning method with statistical techniques. The key advantage for using the algorithm over other approaches, such as a threshold-based segmentation method, is that it supports this quantitative analysis without prior assumptions such as knowledge of the expected dielectric property values that characterize each tissue type. Moreover, it can be used for scenarios where there is a scarcity of data available for supervised learning. Microwave images are formed by solving an inverse scattering problem that is severely ill-posed, which has a significant impact on image quality. A number of strategies have been developed to alleviate the ill-posedness of the inverse scattering problem. The degree of success of each strategy varies, leading to reconstructions that have a wide range of image quality. A requirement for the segmentation technique is the ability to partition tissue types over a range of image qualities, which is demonstrated in the first part of the paper. The segmentation of images into regions of interest corresponding to various tissue types leads to the decomposition of the breast interior into disjoint tissue masks. An array of region and distance-based metrics are applied to compare masks extracted from reconstructed images and ground truth models. The quantitative results reveal the accuracy with which the geometric and dielectric properties are reconstructed. The incorporation of the segmentation that results in a framework that effectively furnishes the quantitative assessment of regions that contain a specific tissue is also demonstrated. The algorithm is applied to reconstructed microwave images derived from breasts with various densities and tissue distributions to demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm and that it is not data-specific. The potential for using the algorithm to assist in diagnosis is exhibited with a tumor tracking example. This example also establishes the usefulness of the approach in evaluating the performance of the reconstruction algorithm in terms of its sensitivity and specificity to malignant tissue and its ability to accurately reconstruct malignant tissue.},
